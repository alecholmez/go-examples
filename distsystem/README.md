# Distributed System
A basic example of a distributed system and concurrency in Go

## Getting Started
To get the distributed system program up and running, make sure you have Go installed and your `$GOPATH` environment variable set.

To build the program, run:
```bash
$ go build
```
To execute the program, run:
```bash
./distsystem
```
This will print various things to your console. Trace the program and see if you can understanding what is happening!
