# Stacks
Basic implementation of a stack in Go

## Getting Started
To get the stack program up and running, make sure you have Go installed and your `$GOPATH` environment variable set.

To build the program, run:
```bash
$ go build
```
To execute the program, run:
```bash
./stacks
```
This will print various things to your console. Trace the program and see if you can understanding what is happening!
